# AWS Target Group Health Checker 

<img style="text-allign:center" src="https://kepler-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/warrensbox/health-check/logo.svg" alt="drawing" width="100" height="130"/>

The `health-check` command-line tool concurrently checks all target groups' health status (for target groups that are attached to a load balancer).  

The program returns 0 when you have at least one healthy target for each service.

## Installation

`health-check` is available for MacOS and Linux based operating systems.

### Homebrew

Installation for MacOS is the easiest with Homebrew. [If you do not have homebrew installed, click here](https://brew.sh/).


```ruby
brew install warrensbox/tap/health-check
```

### Linux

Installation for other linux operation systems.

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/warrensbox/health-check/release/install.sh | bash
```

### Docker
```sh
docker pull warrensbox/health-check:latest
```
or  
```sh
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/warrensbox/health-check/health-check:latest
```

### Install from source

Alternatively, you can install the binary from source [here](https://github.com/warrensbox/health-check/releases)

## How to use
### Pass your ecs-cluster name

1. You must always provide the `ecs-cluster` on the command-line
2. Optionally, you can provide the `delay` option to delay in-between checks
3. Optionally, you can also provide the `attempts` option for the number of attempts for the health check


### Use the `-e` option to exit with 1 when unhealthy

1. You you provide the `-e` flag, the program  will exit with `exit code 1` if any of the target is unhealthy
2. This is useful for continuous delivery - Jenkins, CircleCI and others

1. Likewise, if you dont't provide the `-e` flag, the program  will simply exit with `exit code 0` if any of the target is unhealthy

### Use the `-b` option to disable progress bar

On jenkins you may not want the progress bar to be printed out as it prints out the progress line by line. You can use the `-b` option to disable progress bar. By default, it prints the progress bar.

### With Docker
```sh
docker run --rm \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} \
  -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=${AWS_SESSION_TOKEN} \
  -e AWS_REGION=${AWS_REGION} \
  -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=${AWS_REGION} \
  health-check --ecs-cluster esp-devops --attempts 50 --delay 2 
```

## How it works

1. This command line tool only queries all target group that is attached to a load balancer.
2. Given an ecs cluster is provided, it concurrently checks for the health status for all target groups in that cluster.
3. If a target groups shows *at least* 1 healthy task, it will return the check while other target groups health checks are concurrently going on.  
4. This way, instead of using a loop to check each target group health status - one after another, we can minimize the time by checking all the target groups' health concurrently. The total wait time for the results would be the `number of attempts` X `delay time`*(in seconds)*.
5. The program **will not** exit with *error code 1* unless you pass the `-e` flag for any unhealthy targets.
